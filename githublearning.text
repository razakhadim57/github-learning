Success

She had always dreamed of being a writer. As a young girl, she would spend hours scribbling in her journal, making up stories about far-off lands and magical creatures. As she grew older, the dream never faded, but it seemed to drift further and further away.

After college, she took a "real job" to pay the bills. She worked as an administrative assistant in a cubicle, feeling like a small part of a giant machine. But every night, she would come home and write. She wrote short stories, novels, poetry - anything to express the thoughts and feelings that swirled inside of her.

Years went by, and she began to make a name for herself. She started getting published in small magazines and journals. She wrote articles for online websites and blogs. And finally, she landed a book deal.

The day her book was published, she felt like she was walking on air. She had done it. She had achieved her dream. And as she looked out at the crowd of people gathered at her book signing, she knew that all of her hard work had paid off.

She was a success. And she knew that no matter what lay ahead, she would always be a writer at heart.
